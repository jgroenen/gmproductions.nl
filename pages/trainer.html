    <h3>Presentation Skills Training</h3>

    <p>As a conductor, singer and keynote speaker I’m experienced in addressing an audience. I teach these acquired skills during workshops/sessions in:
    <ul>
        <li>Rhetorical Structure</li>
        <li>Pitch Training</li>
        <li>Body & Voice Control</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Guide to Good Manners & Etiquette</h3>

    <p>From business lunch to state banquets, etiquette is everywhere and can seem very difficult. I’ve learned that a basic understanding of cultural backgrounds and some knowledge of customs can be very effective. Some of the training/workshops I give are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Table Etiquette</li>
        <li>Dresscode Etiquette</li>
        <li>Conversational Etiquette</li>
        <li>International Etiquette</li>
    </ul>
